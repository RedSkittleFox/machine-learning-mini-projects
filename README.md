# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains small machine learning projects that I've created either for personal or university needs.

# Table of Contents
| | NAME | DESCRIPTION | LANGUAGE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | [body-fat](/1.%20body-fat/body-fat.ipynb)| Prediction of body fat percentage using linear models. | Python |
| 2. | [marital-status](/2.%20marital-status/marital-status.ipynb)|Prediction of marital status of the students based on the year on the university using logistic model. | Python |
| 3. | [number-of-errors](/3.%20number-of-errors/number-of-errors.ipynb)| Prediction of errors in the system using logistic model. | Python |
| 4. | [weather-prediction](/4.%20weather-prediction/weather-prediction.ipynb) | Model that predicts if the volleyball team will play the game based on the weather. Model uses Bayes and k-NN classifiers. | Python |
